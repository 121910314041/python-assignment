#program on 5 arithmetic operators
input:

x=int(input("enter a number: "))
y=int(input("enter a number: "))
#addition
result=x+y
print("addition of",x,"and",y,"is",result)
#subtraction
if x>y:
     result=x-y
else:
    result=y-x
print("subtraction of",x,"and",y,"is",result)
#multiplication
result=x*y
print("multiplication of",x,"and",y,"is",result)
#division
if x>y:
     result=x/y
else:
    result=y/x
print("division of",x,"and",y,"is",result)
#modulus
if x>y:
     result=x%y
else:
    result=y%x
print("modulus of",x,"and",y,"is",result)

output:

enter a number: 6
enter a number: 3
addition of 6 and 3 is 9
subtraction of 6 and 3 is 3
multiplication of 6 and 3 is 18
division of 6 and 3 is 2.0

input:

n1=int(input("enter the first number:"))
n2=int(input("enter the second number:"))
def GCD(n1,n2):
    while n2 > 0:
        n1,n2 = n2,n1 % n2
    return n1

def LCM(x, y):
    return n1 * n2 / GCD(n1,n2)

print("LCM is " ,LCM(n1,n2))
print("GCD is " , GCD(n1,n2))

output:

enter the first number:10
enter the second number:50
LCM is  50.0
GCD is  10
